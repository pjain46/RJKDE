\title{Sample from a Gaussian Mixture Model}
\usage{
rnormmix_rcpp(mu, sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu:}{A numeric vector of component means (e.g., c(-1, 0, 1) for a 3-component mixture).}

\item{sigma:}{The common standard deviation for all mixture components (must be > 0).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 1 containing a single random sample from the mixture distribution.
}
\description{
Generates random samples from a mixture of normal distributions with specified means
and a common standard deviation.
}
\details{
This function implements the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Randomly selects one component from the mixture with equal probability
  \item Generates a sample from N($\mu_i$, $\sigma^2$) where $\mu_i$ is the selected component's mean
}
}
\examples{
# Sample from a 2-component mixture
means <- c(-1, 1)  # Means at -1 and 1
rnormmix_rcpp(means, 0.5)  # Common SD = 0.5

# Sample from a 3-component mixture
rnormmix_rcpp(c(-2, 0, 2), 1.0)
